/*
 * WAITING QUEUE
 * Like a mutex, or a spinlock, but:
 *
 * 1. Waiters get a sequence number (FIFO)
 * 2. FIFO is respected within each priority
 * 3. Higher priority threads get in first
 * 4. No wasting of resources, there are no spins
 *
 * When there are no other waiters, this is equivalent to 2 atomic
 * operations for lock, and 2 for unlock.
 *
 * As lightweight and fast as it can be.
 * About 0.5M thread switches/s per WAITING QUEUE, on modern hardware.
 *
 * Be careful: higher priority threads can starve the rest!
